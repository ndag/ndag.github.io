The following videos visualize the results of one of our experiments on
simulated hippocampal networks. A full description of this experiment
is provided <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05432">here</a>.
Briefly put, we simulated the movement of a rat inside five types of
arenas with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 obstacles, and also simulated the
activity in its hippocampus as the rat explored each arena. We were
interested in seeing if our mathematical tools would be able to extract
knowledge of the topology of the arena (e.g. how many obstacles are
contained in each arena) just from the neuronal activity in the
hippocampus. The videos show that our methods are able to do this
successfully: arenas having 4 obstacles are clustered together, those
having 3 obstacles are clustered together, and so on with arenas having
2, 1, and 0 obstacles. Data and computations for this experiment were
generated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowen-dai-8b99088b">Bowen
